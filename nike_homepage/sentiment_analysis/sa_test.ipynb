      "The Nike Uptempo with its iconic design has always been a shoe that I liked. Usually wearing the high variant, I didn’t know how I was going to feel about the low variant. I can honestly say I like this shoe more due to it being lighter on my feet making it better for active wear and just running errands in it. Toe box isn’t tight on my feet which I really like. Also not too tight around the ankle\n",

      "After receiving these kicks I opened the box and was brought back to the 90s for some reason. They have a very nostalgic look. I tried them on and honestly they felt a little bulky at first and a little heavy. Wore them around the house for a couple days to break them in. I wasn’t in love with the way my heels felt in them but I did get used to it. They’re not the most flexible shoe out there.\n",

      "A cool take on a classic model, but I feel like these low tops kind of miss the mark. They feel lightweight, but they’re also clunky to walk in. The laces need to be tied quite tight for them to feel like they won’t slip off, which makes the bow very large and unappealing since it sits at nearly the top of the tongue, covering the logo. Walking in them is okay, they aren’t as comfortable\n",

      "Cool looking , lightweight , comfortable.  But these shoes slides off!!!  What a fail!!!  You should tie them on maximum like before basketball game. I am dissapointed\n",

      "Big fan of the uptempo series which is why I’m giving this even 2-stars.  The quality of the shoe is not the greatest.  Paint is messy and glue marks are clearly visible.  Kinda disappointed based on the price\n",

      "Shoe is wide which is not bad. My main problem is that the shoe slides off. You have tie them to keep them on. Definitely not the best purchase I have made. Most likely will be returning them.\n",
